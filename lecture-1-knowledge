Propositional Logic

OR -- v
if P or Q is True, PvQ is True

IMPLICATION -- →
eg if P is True, and Q is True, then P → Q is True
P is False, Q is True, then P → Q is True.
P is False, Q is False, P → Q is True 
the only way an implication is false is if the Premise is false.
if P is False, the implication makes no CLAIM at all. hence alwyas True

The AI will use this knowledge base to draw conclusions about the world.
